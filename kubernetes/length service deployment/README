This directory contains all of the necessary files to install the hashing service: namespace, deployment file and service file, in a cloud native way using helm chart.

to install the helm chart:
helm upgrade --install length-service .

now port forward the service so you can be able to use it on your local terminal:
kubectl port-forward svc/length-service 8081:8081 -n length-service

now your service is up and running and you can use it to calculate the length of whatever string you want!
example:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/hash -d "Apple" 
result:
5
